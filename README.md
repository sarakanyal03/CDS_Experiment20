# EXPERIMENT 20

## AIM
To study and implement Sorting Algorithm
1. Selection sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Bubble sort
   
## SOFTWARE USED
VSCode

## THEORY
1. *Selection Sort:*
* Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
* Time Complexity: O(n²) for all cases.
* Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).

2. *Insertion Sort:*
* Insertion Sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It picks each element and inserts it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.
* Time Complexity: O(n²) in the worst case; O(n) in the best case (already sorted).
* Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).

3. *Bubble Sort:*
* Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position after each pass.
* Time Complexity: O(n²) in the worst case.
* Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
